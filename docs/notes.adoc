## Observations

. Write and read is always asymmetrical.
Only 10-20% of all info are updates.
. An application contains an endless amount of DTOs and their mappers.
. In most cases services are useless and lead to anemic domain model.
. One-To-Many relationships break incapsulation of bounded context and couple two and more independent bounded contexts.

## Open questions

. How to hook up a command interceptor?
.. Permissions check
.. Validation

## Decisions

. Command always has only one handler.
If not, publisher throws.
. Command always targets one and only entity.
. Avoid Ids of entities generated by the database.
Otherwise, it might cause issues with `*CreatedEvent`, because events might be created before id gets updated.
. An event may have no handlers.
Publisher doesn't throw in this case.
